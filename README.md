# Predictive Analytics
This repository contains web guides, R code, and sample
data to help education data analysts learn how to apply predictive analytics
to education data analyses. This material can also be accessed on the
OpenSDP website at [opensdp.github.io/analysis](https://opensdp.github.io/analysis).


# Purpose

This guide provides an overview of common tools and techniques for implementing 
predictive analytics on education data. Synthetic student-level data is provided 
to illustrate how to go from exploring longitudinal student attainment data to 
developing and evaluating multiple machine learning models of student high 
school completion. 

# Objective

After completing this guide, the user will be familiar with the most common 
principles and technique of predictive analytics and how they can be applied 
to education data analysis problems - particularly through the example of 
student "early warning indicators". 

# Using this Guide

This guide uses synthetic data created by the OpenSDP synthetic data engine.
The data reflects student-level attainment data and is organized to be similar 
to the level of detail available at a state education agency - with a single 
row representing a student-grade-year. This guide does not cover the steps 
needed to clean raw student data. If you are interested in how to assemble 
data like this or the procedure used to generate the data, the code used 
is included in the data subdirectory. 



# Organization

This repository is organized in the following folder structure:

- `code` contains the R code of the analysis (and renders the guide)
- `R` contains R functions necessary to complete the analysis
- `data` contains data necessary to complete the analysis
- `img` contains images to format the guides
- `includes` contains style assets to format the guides
- `man` contains the manuals and descriptive files of the data

# About OpenSDP

[OpenSDP](https://opensdp.github.io) is an online, public repository of analytic
code, tools, and training intended to foster collaboration among education
analysts and researchers in order to accelerate the improvement of our school
systems. The community is hosted by the
[Strategic Data Project](https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu), an initiative of the
[Center for Education Policy Research at Harvard University](https://cepr.harvard.edu).
